# Advanced-Characterization-of-Photonic-Crystals-

## Overview
This repository documents an in-depth analysis of **microstructural characterization techniques for photonic crystals**, with a strong focus on **high-resolution X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)** and **Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)**. The project highlights how synthesis parameters influence the resultant crystal structure and provides optimized protocols for reliable characterization.

## Objectives
- Perform detailed analysis of microstructural characterization methods for photonic crystals.  
- Study and document the correlation between synthesis parameters and resultant crystal structures.  
- Develop optimized characterization protocols for reproducibility and accuracy.  
- Present findings in a technical seminar, acknowledged for analytical depth and clarity.

## Methodology
1. **Synthesis Parameter Analysis**  
   - Collected and processed data on variations in synthesis conditions (temperature, time, precursor ratios).  
   - Mapped effects on structural and optical outcomes.  

2. **High-Resolution XRD**  
   - Employed XRD to determine lattice constants, defect densities, and peak broadening.  
   - Correlated results with synthesis variations.  

3. **SEM Analysis**  
   - Captured high-resolution micrographs to visualize surface morphology and defects.  
   - Compared microstructural features with XRD data for validation.  

4. **Data Correlation and Optimization**  
   - Cross-analyzed results from XRD and SEM.  
   - Identified optimized synthesis-structure relationships.  
   - Compiled standardized characterization protocols.

## Key Results
- Clear correlation between synthesis parameters (e.g., temperature, precursor ratios) and lattice structure quality.  
- Identified structural defects and growth patterns through combined XRD and SEM approaches.  
- Developed optimized characterization workflows that improve reproducibility across experiments.
